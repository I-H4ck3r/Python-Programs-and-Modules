A billing system for a general store with functions such as print, calculate and search amongst old bills. 
Python Tkinter Module is used to create a Graphic user Interface and it gives a beautiful UI design to the normal python functions and commands. 
In main window, different components such as:

The program can be used by any general store shopkeeper to generate bills and store prices in variables inside program code. 
The prices can be adjusted manually and are indicated via comments More items can be stored by creating more Entry and Label in the program code.
